# Testade-algoritmer
Ordspel, inl√§mning 1: Testade algoritmer

Algorithm A: 
Input: Two Strings one for guess and one for correct word. 
-Create function ControllGuess that compare the two strings in guess, correctWord. 
Functionality:
-Create empty Array to store guess. 
-for Loop iterate each letter of guess.
-for Loop iterate again through guess to handle misplaced and incorrect letters. 
-return feedback.
Output: wordle.test.js
 






Algorithm B: 
Input: 
-List of words(array)
-Number for unwanted length    
-Boolean that check if letters should repeat.
Functionality: 
Filter words that have correct length
Check if same letter should occur more than once or if all letters should be unique. 
Output: Test file.
